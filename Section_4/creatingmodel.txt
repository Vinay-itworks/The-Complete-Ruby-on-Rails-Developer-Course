https://github.com/Vinay-itworks/alpha-blog/commit/7e43a8e70c46187a2338a9a4157493858532c37f

Worked with the model article in rails console to created articles.
With 
    $rails console


  1.
    Article.create(title: "first article", 
            description: "Description of first article") # make sure Article is capitalized if using this method

  2.
    article = Article.new
    article.title = "second article"
    article.description = "description of second article"
    article.save

  3.
    article = Article.new(title: "third article", description: "description of third article")
    article.save

Three different ways to create a model from rails console.
