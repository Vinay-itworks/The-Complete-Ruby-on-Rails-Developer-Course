Database

C - Create articles
R - Read articles
U - Update articles
D - Delete articles

----------------------------------------------

Rails uses a middleman called Active Record known as ORM 
  for Object Relational Mapper to communicate between 
  Rails application code and the database

We can simply write Ruby code which gets translated to SQL queries, 
  and then your application interacts with the database 
  this all is done using this models layer.

----------------------------------------------

Articles resource:
1. 'articles' table
2. 'articles' model
3. 'articles' controller
4. views


Scaffold generator command to create an article model (with two attributes), articles controller, 
  views for articles and migration file to create articles table:

  $rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:text

Command to see routes presented in a viewer-friendly way:

  $rails routes --expanded



The line resources :articles in the config/routes.rb file provides the following routes:

- index of articles (GET request)

- new article (GET)

- create article (POST)

- edit article (GET)

- update article (PUT and PATCH)

- show article (GET)

- delete article (DELETE)



From UI perspective ->

- index lists all the articles in the articles table in the database of the app

- new article deals with the form to enter in new article details

- create handles the submission of the items in the new article form

- edit article deals with the form to enter edited information for an existing article

- update article deals with the submission of the edit article form

- show article displays an individual article based on selection

- delete article deletes an article from the articles table
